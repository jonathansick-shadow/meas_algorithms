    @section pipe_tasks_installGaussianPsf_Purpose  Description

    Install a Gaussian PSF model in an exposure.
    If the exposure already has a PSF model then the new model
    has the same sigma and size (width and height in pixels) of the existing model.
    If the exposure does not have a PSF model then the PSF sigma and size
    are taken from the config.

    At present the produced model is always circularly symmetric, but it is planned
    to change this to an elliptical PSF model (only for the case that the exposure
    already has a PSF model), once the necessary PSF object is available.

    A variant of this task may someday exist to estimate the PSF
    from the pixel data if no PSF model is present.
